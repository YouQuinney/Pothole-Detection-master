# Android applicaton for detection of Potholes
### created by Vijay Krishnan

This application will help you to determine the presence of Potholes on a road. The idea is to build an
application for android smartphones which are pre equipped with gyroscopic, accelerometer and GPS
sensors that can be programmed to detect real world physical changes made by the
smartphone device.


## How to use
